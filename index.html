            <strong>The way we work.</strong>
            <div id="colum1">To provide maximum flexibility and transparency for our clients, we use Agile frameworks to build custom solutions.
                The work is planned and delivered in two-week iterations. At the end of each iteration, completed work is
                demonstrated to the client, and the client has the opportunity to reprioritize and tweak requirements for
                the next iteration.</div>

            <div>We start with a conversation. Our goal is to understand your business needs at a high level and determine if
                blockchain technology can offer the right solutions. With short iterations, priorities can be adjusted in
                real-time to ensure we deliver the highest value.</div>
            <div>
                Here’s where we start getting into the weeds. We spend time with your team to understanding your technical requirements and
                take them away to devise a plan. We return with a proposal and estimated costs.
            </div>
            <div>
                Our team will spend two weeks delivering a proof-of-concept that demonstrates blockchain technology applied to your particular
                business use case. See the potential for yourself and adjust your expectations.
            </div>
            <div>
                We’ll continue to deliver new iterations of the product every two weeks. Each iteration offers new value to the customer
                and provides an opportunity to learn how the market reacts to new features.
